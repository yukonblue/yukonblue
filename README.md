## Hi there 👋✨

### 🧑🏻‍💻 My Journey

I've been doing iOS 📱 and macOS 💻 development for the past 10 years.
I'm currently a Senior iOS Engineer at Square,
and prior to that I was a Senior System Engineer at Apple.

### 🛠️ My Projects

The best way for me to learn is by doing, and I try to keep myself up-to-date
by working on projects. Here are some of my projects:

- [Home Camp](https://www.homecamp-ios.ca) 🏕️
- [HeartShip | Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/heartship/id6443454597) 💙
- [Hope for Cheetahs](https://www.hope4cheetahs.org/) 🐆

### 🌱 My Approach to Growth

My approach to growth is based on a holistic approach. My philosophy is that
there are opportunities for learning and growth in every facet of life,
and the best way to grow holistically is to seize those moments.
Every tiny step counts.

Outside of iOS development, I’m passionate about software architectures.
I believe good software architecture is the prerequisite of shipping
high-quality software.

I’m also passionate about operating systems, programming languages
and compilers, graphics, and artificial intelligence.

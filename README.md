## Hi there 👋✨

### 🧑🏻‍💻 My Journey

I've been doing iOS 📱 and macOS 💻 development for the almost 10 years.
I'm currently a Senior iOS Engineer at Square,
and prior to that I was a Senior System Engineer at Apple. Before that
I also worked on large-scale backend systems and low-level graphics drivers.

### 🛠️ My Personal Projects

The best way for me to learn is by doing, and I try to keep myself up-to-date
by working on personal projects during my spare time. Here are some of my projects:

- [Home Camp](https://www.homecamp-ios.ca) 🏕️ - Location-based and real-time alerts, reminders, and actions on iPhone.
- [HeartShip | Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/heartship/id6443454597) 💙 - Soothing melodies on iPhone.
- [CoreColor](https://github.com/yukonblue/CoreColor) 🖍️ - Color modeling and conversion framework in Swift.
- [Hope for Cheetahs](https://www.hope4cheetahs.org/) 🐆 - Promoting cheetah conservation.

### 🌱 My Approach to Growth

My approach to growth is based on a holistic approach. My philosophy is that
there are opportunities for learning and growth in every facet of life,
and the best way to grow holistically is to seize those moments.
Every tiny step counts.

Outside of iOS development, I’m passionate about software architectures.
I believe good software architecture is the prerequisite of shipping
high-quality software. In my spare time I read up on software architectures
across multiple disciplines and identify applicabilities across domains.

I’m also passionate about operating systems, programming languages
and compilers, graphics, and artificial intelligence.

My favorite programming languages are Swift, Rust, C++, Objective-C, and Python.
